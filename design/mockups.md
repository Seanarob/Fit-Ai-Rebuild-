# FitAI UI Mockups

## Design brief
- Dark-only theme with near-black background and lime-green accents
- Cards with soft glow/shadow, rounded corners, consistent padding
- Font hierarchy: prominent numbers/titles, concise copy, pill buttons
- Navigation: auth stack leading into bottom tab bar (Home, Workout, Nutrition, Progress)
- Components: `Card`, `StatRow`, `PrimaryButton`, `ProgressBar`, `SegmentedControl`, `ExerciseCard`, `PhotoGrid`

## Mockup placeholders
- **Onboarding flow**: stack of screens that capture profile info, photos, and the coach-interest toggle (show a progress bar or steps indicator)
- **Home dashboard**: stacked cards for Today’s Training, Nutrition Snapshot, Progress Summary, Coaching Turn-On card, with animation notes
- **Workout tab**: segmented control toggling Generate/Saved/Create, plus session screen layout with rest timer
- **Nutrition tab**: macro summary header with calendar icon (tap reveals monthly calendar showing days target macros were hit), search/scan card, meal cards, quick actions
- **Progress tab**: photo gallery + weekly check-in flow (capture/upload photos + weekly questions + AI feedback) + charts (weight + macros)

## Next steps
- Replace each placeholder with visual mockups (PNG/SVG) once designs are ready
- Reference these components in the frontend implementation iteratively
